                                                        -------------------Pong-clone using SFML-------------------
To run the program, go to "Pong\SMFL1\x64\Debug" and run the "SFML1.exe" file or open the "SFML1.sln" file in "SFML1" folder and run the program. 

Prerequisites:
1. Visual Studio (I used Visual C++ 2022 and Visual Studio Version 17.7.1) or C++ Runtime Libraries
2. SFML 2.6.0 or above (I have included the libraries in the solution directory)

SFML was already linked "dynamically" and it shouldn't cause any issues while running. To run the project without any issues, download the entire project as I uploaded.
If there are any issues with SFML linking, please refer to SFML's official tutorial to link SFML with VS Code. 

NOTE: THIS WAS NOT TESTED WITH CODE::BLOCKS OR OTHER TEXT EDITORS OR C++ IDEs.

1. Once the game is opened, press 'Space Bar' to get past the title and instruction screen.
2. Use A and D to control the bottom bat (player 1) and Left and Right arrow keys to control the top bat (player 2)
3. The ball's speed increases by 1% after every collision with the bat.
4. Players score a point each time when their opponent misses the ball.
5. The game can be closed at any instant by pressing the 'Esc' key.
